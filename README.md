# IMDbPY

**IMDbPY** is a Python package useful to retrieve and manage the data of the [IMDb][imdb] movie database about movies, people, characters and companies.


## Revamp notice

Starting on November 2017 many things were improved and simplified:

- move the package to Python 3
- removed dependencies: SQLObject, C compiler, BeautifulSoup
- removed the "mobile" and "httpThin" parsers
- introduced a testsuite ([please help with it!][testsuite])
- the old, Python 2, version is available in the *imdbpy-legacy* branch (mostly unsupported)


## Main features

* written in pure Python 3
* platform-independent
* can retrieve data from both the IMDb's web server and a local copy of the whole database
* a simple and complete API
* released under the terms of the GPL 2 license
* IMDbPY powers many other softwares and has been used in various research papers. [Curious about that][ecosystem]?


## Code example

    from imdb import IMDb
    ia = IMDb()

    # print the director(s) of a movie
    the_matrix = ia.get_movie('0133093')
    print(the_matrix['director'])

    # search for a person
    for person in ia.search_person('Mel Gibson'):
        print(person.personID, person['name'])
