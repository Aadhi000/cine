How to make a release
=====================

**During development**

*imdb.version*

    Be sure that the ``__version__`` variable is up-to-date.

*CHANGELOG.txt*

    When a major fix or feature is committed, the changelog must be updated.


**When a new release is planned**

*CHANGELOG.txt*

    The date of the release has to be added.


**How to release**

- Commit the above changes.

- Add an annotated tag like *year.month.day*; e.g.: ``git tag -a 2020.09.25``
  (the commit message is not important).

- ``python3 setup.py sdist``

- ``python3 setup.py bdist_wheel``

- ``git push``

- ``git push --tags``

- Don't forget to push both sources and tags to both the GitHub and Bitbucket
  repositories (they are kept in sync).

- Upload to pypi: ``twine upload dist/cinemagoer-*`` (you probably need a recent
  version of twine and the appropriate ~/.pypi file)

- The new tar.gz must also be uploaded
  to https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdbpy/ (along with a new "news").

- Create a new release on GitHub, including the changelog and the whl and tar.gz files.
  https://github.com/cinemagoer/cinemagoer/releases/new


**communication**

- update the *content/news* section of https://github.com/cinemagoer/website

- add a news on https://sourceforge.net/p/imdbpy/news/new

- send an email to imdbpy-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and imdbpy-help@lists.sourceforge.net


**After the release**

*CHANGELOG.txt*

    Add a new section for the next release, on top.

After that, you can commit the above changes with a message like "version bump"
