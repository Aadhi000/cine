Deployment and release
======================

How to deploy and release a new version of IMDbPY.

**While development is ongoing**

*setup.cfg*

    The ``egg_info`` section must include the lines below::

      [egg_info]
      tag_build = dev
      tag_date = true

*setup.py*

    The ``version`` variable must be set to the **next** version.

*imdb/__init__.py*

    When a major fix or feature is committed, the ``VERSION`` and
    ``__version__`` variables must be updated to something in the form
    *{next.version}devISO8601DATE* (not mandatory, but...)

*docs/Changelog.txt*

    When a major fix or feature is committed, the changelog must be updated.


**When a new release is planned**

*setup.cfg*

    In the ``egg_info`` section, the lines mentioned above must be
    commented out.

*setup.py*

    Not touched.

*imdb/__init__.py*

    The *devISO8601DATE* part must be removed from the version variables.

*docs/Changelog.txt*

    The date of the release has to be added.


**How to release**

- Commit the above changes.

- Add an annotated tag like *major.minor*; e.g.: ``git tag -a 6.3``
  (the commit message is not important).

- ``python3 setup.py sdist``

- ``python3 setup.py bdist_wheel``

- ``git push``

- ``git push --tags``

- Don't forget to push both sources and tags to both the GitHub and Bitbucket
  repositories (they are kept in sync).

- Upload to pypi: ``twine upload dist/IMDbPY-*`` (you probably need a recent
  version of twine and the appropriate ~/.pypi file)

- The new tar.gz must also be uploaded
  to https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdbpy/ (along with a new "news").


**After the release**

*setup.cfg*

    Uncomment the two lines again.

*setup.py*

    Bump the ``version`` variable.

*imdb/__init__.py*

    Bump the ``VERSION`` and ``__version__`` variables.

*docs/Changelog.txt*

    Add a new section for the next release, on top.
